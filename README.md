## Introduction
 In this project we will explore and analysis then visualise dataset for bank customers in order to understand the relationship 
 between the customers in different situations, but our dataset needs cleaning because it have (unknown) data that's refer to 
 null values in specific columns while other columns have (unknown) data doesn't refer to null values, Then we need to clarify 
 the values in certain columns such as Gender to "Female","Male" instead of "F","M", finally the data will be vislize in varity
 charts to presents the relationship and drive the important insights.
